# 🌀 Snapfront Theory

This repository contains the theoretical framework, code, and simulations supporting the paper:

> **"Temporal Misinterpretation of Quantum Superposition:  
> The Snapfront Hypothesis and the Weird Concurrence Threshold" – by James Kreis**

## 📖 Abstract

This theory proposes that quantum superposition is not fundamental, but a perceptual illusion caused by relativistic time dilation and gravitational curvature. When coherence reaches a critical threshold—defined by **Naketa's Equation**—a deterministic collapse event called the **snapfront** occurs.
